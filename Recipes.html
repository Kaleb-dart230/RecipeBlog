After blind baking it, we fill it with frangipane – a creamy almond filling made with equal amounts of almond flour, butter and sugar – and top with apple slices that were tossed with a bit of sugar and pan fried in butter until perfectly golden.</p>

                <p class="card text">A bolo de rolo is a true labor of love: Each cake layer is baked separately, spread with sweet guava paste, and rolled into the next layer. Although it's time-consuming, the end result is as beautiful as it is delicious. The bolo de rolo forms a tight cylinder that looks like a hypnotic spiral of guava paste alternating with the thin layers of cake. 

The guava gives the bolo de rolo a distinguishing tropical taste, and a light sprinkling of granulated sugar on top adds an extra texture and sweetness. You've never had a cake quite like this one.</p>

                <p class="card text">If you, like me, cannot find passion fruit, the frozen pulp is just fine to make the ice cream. Goya is one of the brands that I usually find at my supermarket.
If you’re lucky and can get your hands on the real deal, make the sauce. It is delicious and looks great with the seeds (which are edible!). Not to mention, rumor has it that after eating a passion fruit, you’ll fall in love with the next person your eyes fall upon! ???</p>

                <p class="card text">Literally meaning ‘little kiss of coconut’ this is another Brazilian truffle that’ll steal your heart with its divine taste and texture. Made with condensed milk, sugar and coconut flakes, the aptly christened balls are also rolled in sugar or coconut flakes for that crunchy finish. With the goodness of coconut in every bite, perfectly complemented by the sweetened condensed milk, beijinhos are the stars of every birthday party in Brazil. These fairer cousins of the chocolatey brigadeiros are popular with kids and adults alike, and also make for perfect Christmas treats. Pop in a few after your hearty meal for the lingering taste of one of the most sought-after Brazilian desserts.</p>

                <p class="card text">Brigadeiro is a remarkably simple recipe made with just butter, cocoa powder, and condensed milk. The mixed ingredients are molded into golf ball size and then rolled around in chocolate sprinkles. The condensed milk is gooey and sweet, so when you bite into a brigadeiro, you get a chewy mouthful of chocolatey, buttery flavor. But buyer beware: Brigadeiro is super rich, dense, and extremely tasty, so it's easy to overdo it when you get your hands on a box of these bite-sized treats. </p>
