                <p class="card text accordion-body">Literally meaning ‘little kiss of coconut’ this is another Brazilian truffle that’ll steal your heart with its divine taste and texture. Made with condensed milk, sugar and coconut flakes, the aptly christened balls are also rolled in sugar or coconut flakes for that crunchy finish. With the goodness of coconut in every bite, perfectly complemented by the sweetened condensed milk, beijinhos are the stars of every birthday party in Brazil. These fairer cousins of the chocolatey brigadeiros are popular with kids and adults alike, and also make for perfect Christmas treats. Pop in a few after your hearty meal for the lingering taste of one of the most sought-after Brazilian desserts.

              <ul>
        <li>Combine the sweetened condensed milk, butter and coconut in a medium-sized saucepan or Dutch Oven.
</li>
        <li><br>Cook, over medium-low heat, until thickened. You’ll know it’s ready when you run your spatula through the middle of the beijinho and it leaves a trail, taking a while for it to come back together. If you prefer the use a thermometer, the beijinho is ready at around 200º-210ºF (95º-99ºC).
</li>
             <li><br>Transfer the beijinho to a buttered plate, then cover with plastic wrap. Make sure the plastic wrap touches all the surface of the beijinho, as that will prevent it from drying out.
</li>
             <li><br>Let it cool completely to room temperature so you can shape and decorate the beijinhos.
</li>

                <p class="card text accordion-body"></p>
              <ul>
       <li> Once the beijinho has cooled to room temperature, take small portions of the mixture and roll them between your palms to form small balls, about the size of a cherry. Since the mixture is sticky, it helps if you grease your hands with a little butter.
</li>
            <li><br>Roll the balls in grated coconut, making sure each ball gets thoroughly coated.
</li>
   <li><br>It is traditional to insert a clove into the top of each beijinho, but you can skip that step if desired.
</li>
    
                  <li><br>These treats are traditionally served in brigadeiro cups. If you can’t find them, you can use mini cupcake cups (although they are a bit bigger than a standard beijinho) or just as-is.
</li>
                  
                  <li><br>Important: If your guests are not familiar with beijinhos, remind them to remove the cloves before eating! </li>
