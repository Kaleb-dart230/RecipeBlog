                <p class="card text accordion-body">A bolo de rolo is a true labor of love: Each cake layer is baked separately, spread with sweet guava paste, and rolled into the next layer. Although it's time-consuming, the end result is as beautiful as it is delicious. The bolo de rolo forms a tight cylinder that looks like a hypnotic spiral of guava paste alternating with the thin layers of cake. The guava gives the bolo de rolo a distinguishing tropical taste, and a light sprinkling of granulated sugar on top adds an extra texture and sweetness. You've never had a cake quite like this one.</p>

              <ul>
        <li>Preheat oven to 180°C (350°F).
</li>
        <li><br>Put the guava paste into a small bowl, add a little water and mash it up with a fork. The idea is to loosen it up so you have a smooth, jam-like consistency – you may find gently heating it in a microwave, on the stove, or simply adding hot water will help you achieve this. Once it is smooth and jammy, set aside – you’ll need it later on.
</li>
             <li><br>Put the sugar and butter in a mixing bowl and stir with a sturdy wooden spoon until well combined.
</li>
             <li><br>Stir in the egg yolks one at a time, mixing each one in well before adding the next.
</li>
             <li><br>Add in the flour and stir well until everything is smooth.
</li>
                  
                   <li><br>Beat the eggs whites until you have firm peaks, then fold into the cake mixture.

                 <h2>Step 2: Baking</h2>
                <div class="card " ></div>
                </div>
                <div class="card-body ">
                </div>
                <p class="card text accordion-body"></p>
              <ul>
       <li>Lay baking parchment onto a baking tray, grease with butter and sprinkle with a little flour. Now spread a very thin layer of the batter onto the parchment using a spatula. Make the thickness of the layer is as even as possible – aim for 2mm thick.
</li>
            <li><br>Put the tray on the top shelf of the oven and bake for 4 minutes. After 4 minutes, take a look at the cake layer – it should be just set. If any part is still bubbling or still looks liquidy then give it another 30 seconds or so. Watch it carefully because cake this thin will dry out very quickly.
</li>
   <li><br>Lay a damp cloth (a tea towel is perfect) on a flat surface. Turn out your thin sheet of cake onto the cloth and spread a layer of the guava jam over the entire surface. Now the fun part! Start to roll the cake up like a piece of paper. The first part is tricky as you don’t want to leave a hole/gap – but don’t worry if it cracks a bit. Once you’ve got the roll going you can either simply roll it up using your hands or lift the damp cloth up and over to roll the sheet up. Put the mini roll to one side.
</li>
                  
                  <li><br>Now you simply repeat the process. Spread a thin layer of batter onto the parchment (I found I was able to re-use the same parchment again and again – just make sure it’s well greased to prevent sticking). Bake for 4 minutes, spread with guava jam and roll it up. Of course, for the second layer (and all subsequent) you will be rolling the main roll into the newly baked sheet – line up the seam on the main roll with the starting edge of the new sheet.

</li>
    
                  <li><br>Once you’ve used up all the batter you can dust the outer surface of the cake in a little more caster sugar (because it isn’t quite sweet enough yet, right?). Finally, trim the edges with a sharp knife to tidy it up.
